Objective: To provide a systematic approach for the evaluation of acute chest pain in the emergency setting. Methods: We reviewed current literature and guidelines for chest pain evaluation including risk stratification tools, diagnostic testing, and decision-making algorithms. Results: A structured approach using validated risk scores (HEART, TIMI, GRACE) combined with appropriate diagnostic testing (ECG, troponins, imaging) can effectively stratify patients and guide management decisions. Conclusion: Implementation of systematic chest pain protocols improves patient outcomes and reduces unnecessary admissions.",
